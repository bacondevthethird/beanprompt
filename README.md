beanprompt lets you elevate a command line from user to admin to system

new command: elevate


**examples:**
elevate /r /s

runs a command line as SYSTEM

the options are /s (system), /a (admin) and /u (user)

/r specifies if you actually want to have privileges or not
eg:
elevate /r /s
will give you **genuine** system privileges

but
elevate /s
will **not** give you system privileges it **fakes** it ðŸ˜±ðŸ˜±ðŸ˜±ðŸ˜±
